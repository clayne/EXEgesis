// the instruction uses "mem" for the memory operand, whereas it should be using
// "m128", similar to the 128-bit AVX version of the instruction.
absl::Status FixOperandsOfLddqu(InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Updates the operands of LODS, SCAS and STOS instructions. These instructions
// are documented in the Intel manual in two forms: a form that doesn't use any
// operands and that encodes the size of its operands using a suffix of the
// mnemonic, and a form that uses explicit operands (even though all the
// registers in these operands are hard-coded and they can't be changed).
// The operand-less version is just fine, but the version with operands has two
// validity/consistency problems:
// 1. It does not specify the register operand (even though it is required
//    according to the textual description of the instruction), and
// 2. it uses m8/m16/m32/m64 for the memory operand, even though this type is
//    otherwise used for memory operands specified through the ModR/M byte and
//    allowing any addressing mode.
// This transform fixes this problem by adding the register operand and by
// changng the memory operand to something more explicit.
absl::Status FixOperandsOfLodsScasAndStos(InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Updates the operands of SGTD and SIDT instructions. In the Intel manual, they
// are listed as SGTD m and SITD m, suggesting that they compute the effective
// address of the operand, but do not actually access the memory at this
// address. However, this is not the case, and they both write an 80-bit value
// at the operand. According to another part of the SDM, the correct operand
// type of these instructions is m16&32.

// Fixes the operands of VMOVQ. The Intel manual lists two variants of VMOVQ for
// XMM registers: one that reads the value from another XMM registers, and one
// that reads it from a location in memory. Both of these instructions use the
// same encoding, and the only difference is in how they use the ModR/M byte.
// This transform turns the second operand into xmm2/m64 for all occurences of
// this instruction; Removing the duplicate entries is left to
// RemoveDuplicateInstructions.
// Note that the transform must run before AddOperandInfo and
// RemoveDuplicateInstructions.
absl::Status FixOperandsOfVMovq(InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Fixes the ambiguous operand "reg". There are two cases in the 2015 version
// of the manual:
// 1. Instruction LAR. In this case, reg means any of r32 and r64, and the
//    binary encoding of these two versions is actually different (one uses the
//    REX.W prefix, the other doesn't, at least according to LLVM).
// 2. All other instructions. Here, the manual says that reg means r32 or r64,
//    but the instruction assigns a value to the lowest 16 bits of the register
//    and fills the rest with zeros. The binary encoding is the same for both
//    operand sizes. In practice, we can view this as an instruction that works
//    only on the 32-bit argument, and depends on the standard 64-bit register
//    behavior, i.e. whenever a 32-bit register is changed, the bits of its
//    64-bit extension are automatically filled with zeros.
//
// This transform fixes the reg operand in a way that depends on the mnemonic of
// the instruction. If the instruction is LAR, it replaces the 'reg' entry with
// two new entries, for r32 and r64.
// For all other instructions from the current version of the manual, it just
// renames reg to r32.
// TODO(ondrasej): Assemblers actually support the 64-bit version of all
// instructions fixed by this transform. Instead of making them 32-bit only, we
// might want to add a 64-bit entries to be compatible with what the assemblers
// do.
absl::Status FixRegOperands(InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Removes the implicit ST(0) operand from instructions that do not require it
// and where it is not produced by the LLVM disassembler. In all cases, this
// operand is encoded neither in the ModR/M byte nor in the opcode (using the
// "opcode+i" encoding). The instructions from which the operand is removed are
// selected by their binary encoding specification, because the mnemonic is not
// enough (two different instructions with the same mnemonic might work with the
// ST(0) register in different ways).
// Note that this transform depends on the results of RenameOperands.
absl::Status RemoveImplicitST0Operand(InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Removes the implicit operands that are specified as <operand-name> in the
// SDM. These operands are added automatically by the LLVM assembler, but they
// are encoded neither in the ModR/M byte nor in the opcode of the instruction
// (using the "+i" encoding), and they do not appear in the LLVM disassembly.
// Since the Intel SDM uses the <> notation only in this case, we match the
// operands by name.
absl::Status RemoveImplicitOperands(InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);
