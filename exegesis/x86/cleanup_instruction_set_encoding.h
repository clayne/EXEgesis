// Fixes the binary encoding specification of instructions that write to or read
// from a memory address that is specified as segment + fixed offset, and the
// offset is encoded as an immediate value in the instruction. For some of these
// instructions, namely MOV to/from a fixed offset do not have this immediate
// value in the binary encoding specification in the Intel manual. This might be
// because the size of the immediate value depends on the use of the address
// size override prefix. This transform fixes these instructions by replacing
// the original one with two new instructions (one with the prefix and one
// without) with the correct binary encoding specification.
absl::Status AddMissingMemoryOffsetEncoding(
    InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Adds the missing ModR/M and immediates specifiers to the binary encoding
// specification of instructions where they are missing. Most of these cases are
// actual errors in the Intel manual rather than conversion errors that could be
// fixed elsewhere.
absl::Status AddMissingModRmAndImmediateSpecification(
    InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Fixes and cleans up binary encodings of SET* instructions. These are
// instructions that look at a combination of status flag and update an 8-bit
// register or memory location based on the value of these flags.
// There are two problems with these instructions in the Intel manual:
// 1. All of them are missing the /r (or /0) specifier stating that there must
//    be a ModR/M byte.
// 2. The REX versions of the instructions are redundant, because the REX prefix
//    is used only for the register index extension bits.
// This transform adds the /0 specification (because the modrm.reg bits are not
// used for anything), and it removes the REX versions of the instructions.
absl::Status FixAndCleanUpEncodingSpecificationsOfSetInstructions(
    InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Fixes the binary encodings of POP FS and POP GS instructions. These
// instructions exist in three versions: 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit. In protected
// mode, either the 32-bit or the 64-bit is the default, depending on the
// default address size of the given segment.
// * In the 64-bit protected mode, the 64-bit version is the default, the 32-bit
//   version can't be encoded, and the 16-bit version can be obtained by using
//   the operand size override prefix. Adding a REX.W prefix to the instruction
//   does not change anything apart from the binary encoding size.
// * In the 32-bit protected mode, the 32-bit version is the default, the 64-bit
//   version can be obtained by using the REX.W prefix, and the 16-bit version
//   can be obtained by using the operand size override prefix.
// The Intel manual has all three versions, and they all appear without any
// prefixes at all. This transform adds the operand size override prefix to the
// 16-bit version, keeps the 32-bit version as is (it will be later removed as
// non-encodable anyway), keeps the 64-bit version as is (this will be kept as
// the default, since we're focusing on the 64-bit protected mode), and adds a
// new version of the 64-bit version that uses the REX.W prefix.
absl::Status FixEncodingSpecificationOfPopFsAndGs(
    InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Fixes the binary encodings of PUSH FS and PUSH GS instructions. These
// instructions exist in three versions symmetrical to the POP FS and POP GS
// instructions (see the comment on FixEncodingSpecificationOfPopFsAndGs
// for more details).
// The Intel manual lists only one version of each. This transform adds the
// missing versions and extends them with the necessary operand size override
// and REX.W prefixes.
absl::Status FixEncodingSpecificationOfPushFsAndGs(
    InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Fixes the binary encoding specification of the instruction XBEGIN. The
// specifications in the Intel manual have only the opcode, but there is also a
// code offset passed as an immediate value, and the 16-bit version of the
// instruction requires an operand-size override prefix.
absl::Status FixEncodingSpecificationOfXBegin(
    InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Fixes common errors in the binary encoding specification that were carried
// from the Intel reference manuals. Errors fixed by this transform are:
// 1. Replaces 0f with 0F,
// 2. Replaces imm8 with ib,
// 3. Replaces .0 at the end of a VEX prefix with .W0.
absl::Status FixEncodingSpecifications(InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Since the October 2019 version of the SDM, encoding specifications of some
// instructions contain additional information about the ModR/M mod bits in the
// form "(mod=?? + optional comment)". For now, these comments match the
// register information available elsewhere, so we dorp the whole parenthesis
// without parsing it. We might need to parse these in the future.

// instruction set, and stores the parsed proto in the specialized x86 encoding
// specification field. Assumes that instruction.raw_encoding_specification
// contains the encoding specification in the format used in the Intel SDM.
// Returns an error if parsing of any of the encoding specifications fails.
absl::Status ParseEncodingSpecifications(InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Converts encoding specification of X87 FPU instructions that use direct
// addressing into ModR/M format. This is done for avoiding false multi-byte
// opcodes caused by those instructions, and use same single byte opcode as
// indirect-addressing versions of the same instructions.
absl::Status ConvertEncodingSpecificationOfX87FpuWithDirectAddressing(

absl::Status AddRexWPrefixedVersionOfStr(InstructionSetProto* instruction_set);

// Normalizes the LIG/LLIG flag in the raw encoding specification. The LLIG
// version was introduced in 2021-06 version of the SDM, and it seems that the
// convention is to use LIG in VEX instructions and LLIG in EVEX instructions.
// We normalize both versions to LIG to keep the same format as in the previous
// versions of the SDM.
